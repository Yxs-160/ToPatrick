Hello, Patrick:
Thank you for writing such great software for the community!(https://www.patrickmin.com/viewvox/).
However, when I use it for visualization, the files that need to be visualized have the .binvox suffix, I try to use viewvox for visualization and take screenshots, but the visualization results don't seem to be in the same format as I need.
the image above is the result of my visualization using The top image is the result of my visualization using viewvox, and the bottom image is the image in another paper. 
I need to represent a single voxel like in the thesis, do you know how to do this? I will add your page to the article later. Thank you in advance!
